# FINTECHOISIS / GPIR Project Status

**PROJECT:** FINTECHOSIS — Global Payments Intelligence Repository  
**Current Stage:** Stage 1 — scalable registry pilot  
**Current Prompt:** PHASE 2 — Zero-Cost Security Hardening
**Current Milestone:** M-16 — Zero-Cost Security Hardening Foundation
**Last Completed Prompt:** PHASE 2 — Zero-Cost Security Hardening
**Last Verified Commit:** `082cad751e3a4bc13136cfc1397dd7f599a50514`
**Current Development Status:** Phase 2 security baseline implemented and validated; M-10 remains PARTIAL and later privacy/provenance/Trust Centre/AI phases remain gated.

## COMPLETED

- Static HTML/CSS/vanilla JavaScript GitHub Pages architecture.
- Performance tier, lazy loading, responsive images and reduced-motion support.
- Shared navigation, ticker, search, i18n, dashboard/lightbox and page templates.
- Structured JSON content and trusted-source verification model.
- Content schema and architecture guardrail documentation.
- Dev-time content contract validation for current records and relationships.
- Permanent project log, backlog, status snapshot and development governance documents.
- Canonical reference-based content registry with typed pilot records for
  countries, regions, source, announcement and intelligence.
- Registry validation for IDs, types, slugs, source references, relationships
  and page targets.
- Least-privilege GitHub Actions security/integrity workflow.
- Repository-native internal HTML-link validation and security disclosure
  guidance.

## IN PROGRESS

- None recorded.

## ACTIONABLE NEXT

- Expand structured content registry coverage using verified evidence.
- Extend the page generator to consume registry records only after a second
  pilot proves parity with existing country/intelligence pages.
- Improve repository search only after measured need and within current
  performance thresholds.
- Extend reader-facing relationship and evidence discovery using existing
  templates and data.
- Add low-cost governance/monitoring checks that reflect documented contracts.
- Reconcile all known pending work before starting another implementation prompt.
- Reconcile external pending work before authorizing the next implementation.
- Preserve the Phase 2 workflow and review remaining SEC items before any later
  security or privacy work.

See [GPIR_BACKLOG.md](GPIR_BACKLOG.md) for IDs, dependencies and acceptance criteria.

## PARKED

- Expanded source registry, pending manual domain verification.
- Controlled source ingestion, pending a reviewed workflow outside runtime.
- Change detection, AI classification/extraction and the GPIR intelligence
  engine, pending governed inputs and evaluation.
- Country and corridor engines, pending schema and evidence scale-up.
- Production automation, pending the preceding workflow dependencies.

## BLOCKED

- Public API/backend knowledge store, pending explicit architecture approval,
  operational ownership and measured need.
- Production observability, pending an approved free monitoring and privacy
  model.

## DEVELOPMENT PRIORITY

- **P0:** Protect the existing build and resolve backlog conflicts.
- **P1:** Complete M-10 registry work after reconciliation.
- **P2:** Execute approved Stage 1 registry/governance increments.
- **P3:** Improve reader experience based on measured needs.
- **P4:** Develop governed intelligence automation.
- **P5:** Address future and experimental scale requirements.

## NEXT DEVELOPMENT GATE

**Reconcile all known pending work before starting the next implementation
prompt.** P1 AUDIT-001 and AUDIT-002 are closed by Prompt 13.

Prompt 12 adds a live-site condition to that gate: review the two P1 audit
findings before authorizing the next implementation prompt.

## KNOWN ISSUES

- The performance audit reports one missing image dimension warning and two
  byte-identical duplicate-logo warnings; these predate Prompt 09 and are
  advisory.
- Earlier prompt-level history is not available in the repository record.
- The repository has no backend, database, API, live ingestion, AI pipeline or
  production observability service.
- Prompt 10 registry, validator and governance files are committed in
  `7813132e2fd21a746932778b8c8459bb62dafaab`.
- Prompt 11 governance updates are committed in
  `fe32af6b0b58d96559ac8a6c33b0e77354a3a911`.
- P5: `pages/regions/sepa.html` is not a repository route and returns 404; the
  current canonical route is `pages/regions/europe.html`.
- SEC-001 remains blocked by GitHub Pages response-header limitations; no CSP,
  X-Frame-Options, Permissions-Policy, Referrer-Policy or X-Content-Type-
  Options response headers are currently deployed.
- Google Fonts and the public FX API remain documented third-party risks.

## ARCHITECTURE STATUS

**PROTECTED**

The existing static architecture, URLs, content governance, performance tier,
reduced-motion support, search, ticker, i18n, dashboards and page templates
remain protected under [ARCHITECTURE_GUARDRAIL.md](ARCHITECTURE_GUARDRAIL.md).

## PRODUCTION CHANGE STATUS

- No HTML, CSS, runtime JavaScript, URL or generated production page was
  modified by Prompt 10. The new registry is build-time data only.
- `assets/data/content-registry.json` and the existing validator were extended
  for the pilot.
- Four governance Markdown files were created under `docs/`.
- The existing Word document was deliberately not modified; it is a privacy
  policy, not a project log. The repository-native Markdown record is the
  authoritative new project memory.
- Prompt 12 was audit-only; Prompt 13 changed only the authorized generator,
  affected generated pages, legacy research links and governance records.
- M-12 was verified as the Prompt 12 audit result, but no separate M-12
  milestone was formally declared in the project record.
- Prompt 13 remediation and governance updates are committed in
  `fea8228b4d52363a92dcd61ea48224f2f74a0a01`.
- Phase 2 security controls are committed in
  `b326c4501008e857e1efd48db6f59a8a10e31aa6`; no application, content, asset
  or runtime page files were changed.
