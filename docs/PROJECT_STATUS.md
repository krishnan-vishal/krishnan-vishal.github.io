# FINTECHOISIS / GPIR Project Status

**PROJECT:** FINTECHOSIS — Global Payments Intelligence Repository  
**Current Stage:** Stage 1 — scalable registry pilot  
**Current Prompt:** PROMPT-11 — GPIR Backlog Reconciliation & Pending Work Intake
**Current Milestone:** M-10 — PARTIAL: Scalable GPIR Content Registry Foundation  
**Last Completed Prompt:** PROMPT-10 (partial milestone)  
**Last Verified Commit:** `186d2ca97cdae6674f55a8319c9b9a37827e71f1`
**Current Development Status:** Backlog reconciliation complete; implementation is gated until external work is captured and reconciled.

## COMPLETED

- Static HTML/CSS/vanilla JavaScript GitHub Pages architecture.
- Performance tier, lazy loading, responsive images and reduced-motion support.
- Shared navigation, ticker, search, i18n, dashboard/lightbox and page templates.
- Structured JSON content and trusted-source verification model.
- Content schema and architecture guardrail documentation.
- Dev-time content contract validation for current records and relationships.
- Permanent project log, backlog, status snapshot and development governance documents.
- Canonical reference-based content registry with typed pilot records for
  countries, regions, source, announcement and intelligence.
- Registry validation for IDs, types, slugs, source references, relationships
  and page targets.

## IN PROGRESS

- None recorded.

## ACTIONABLE NEXT

- Expand structured content registry coverage using verified evidence.
- Extend the page generator to consume registry records only after a second
  pilot proves parity with existing country/intelligence pages.
- Improve repository search only after measured need and within current
  performance thresholds.
- Extend reader-facing relationship and evidence discovery using existing
  templates and data.
- Add low-cost governance/monitoring checks that reflect documented contracts.
- Reconcile all known pending work before starting another implementation prompt.

See [GPIR_BACKLOG.md](GPIR_BACKLOG.md) for IDs, dependencies and acceptance criteria.

## PARKED

- Expanded source registry, pending manual domain verification.
- Controlled source ingestion, pending a reviewed workflow outside runtime.
- Change detection, AI classification/extraction and the GPIR intelligence
  engine, pending governed inputs and evaluation.
- Country and corridor engines, pending schema and evidence scale-up.
- Production automation, pending the preceding workflow dependencies.

## BLOCKED

- Public API/backend knowledge store, pending explicit architecture approval,
  operational ownership and measured need.
- Production observability, pending an approved free monitoring and privacy
  model.

## DEVELOPMENT PRIORITY

- **P0:** Protect the existing build and resolve backlog conflicts.
- **P1:** Complete M-10 registry work after reconciliation.
- **P2:** Execute approved Stage 1 registry/governance increments.
- **P3:** Improve reader experience based on measured needs.
- **P4:** Develop governed intelligence automation.
- **P5:** Address future and experimental scale requirements.

## NEXT DEVELOPMENT GATE

**Reconcile all known pending work before starting the next implementation
prompt.**

## KNOWN ISSUES

- The performance audit reports one missing image dimension warning and two
  byte-identical duplicate-logo warnings; these predate Prompt 09 and are
  advisory.
- Earlier prompt-level history is not available in the repository record.
- The repository has no backend, database, API, live ingestion, AI pipeline or
  production observability service.
- Prompt 10 registry, validator and governance files are committed in
  `7813132e2fd21a746932778b8c8459bb62dafaab`.
- Prompt 11 governance updates are the only current uncommitted changes.

## ARCHITECTURE STATUS

**PROTECTED**

The existing static architecture, URLs, content governance, performance tier,
reduced-motion support, search, ticker, i18n, dashboards and page templates
remain protected under [ARCHITECTURE_GUARDRAIL.md](ARCHITECTURE_GUARDRAIL.md).

## PRODUCTION CHANGE STATUS

- No HTML, CSS, runtime JavaScript, URL or generated production page was
  modified by Prompt 10. The new registry is build-time data only.
- `assets/data/content-registry.json` and the existing validator were extended
  for the pilot.
- Four governance Markdown files were created under `docs/`.
- The existing Word document was deliberately not modified; it is a privacy
  policy, not a project log. The repository-native Markdown record is the
  authoritative new project memory.
